#Description 
A GoodCorp developer wants to publish a new Docker image. He uses an environment variable storing a flag at build time, and assures you that this secret is not visible to the public. The image is [anssi/fcsc2024-forensics-layer-cake-1](https://hub.docker.com/r/anssi/fcsc2024-forensics-layer-cake-1).
